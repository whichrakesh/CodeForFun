\textbf{Classification of loops for parallelization in GPGPU architecture} \hfill \emph{Ongoing}\\
\textsl{Undergraduate Thesis Project under Prof. Supratim Biswas}\hfill
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
\item Working on empirical analysis of loops and array references in benchmark programs to identify most common patterns which would help in designing efficient algorithms for parallelization
\item Main goal is to design an efficient algorithm and develop an abstraction of GPGPU architecture in the form of cost metrics to analyse the performance of our algorithm for common patterns against other popular models like polyhedral model
\end{itemize}
